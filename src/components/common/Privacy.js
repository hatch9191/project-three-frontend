            <h3>IP addresses</h3>
            <p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. They help us to improve the Site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate.</p>
            <p>Please note that the law in the EU has changed in respect of the serving of all non-essential cookies (and other similar web tools), and that your prior consent is now required before a non-essential cookie is installed on your hard drive. We will introduce new measures (if applicable or necessary) and in accordance with good industry practice prior to May 2012 to further abide by our legal requirements. Until that time, your continued use of the Site and your current browser settings shall be deemed as your prior consent to the use of cookies by us. Please note that cookies which are essential to the operation of the Site may have already been installed on your hard drive and do not require your prior consent, however this Privacy Policy explains our use of all cookies and how you may delete or block them. Please note that by deleting or blocking cookies, it may impact on your use of the Site.</p>
            <h3>Where we store your personal data</h3>
            <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
            <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
            <h3>Uses made of the information</h3>
            <p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.</li>
              <li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.</li>
              <li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.</li>
              <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.</li>
              <li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, to provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by post or telephone.</p>
            <p>If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.</p>
            <p>If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.</p>
            <p>You may choose to withdraw your consent to us using your data in the way described at any time by choosing the ‘unsubscribe’ option situated on the email and/or other form of communication you may receive from us.</p>
            <p>We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
            <h3>Disclosure of your information</h3>
            <p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined with reference to the definitions of “holding undertaking” and “subsidiary undertaking” in section 1162 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
            <h3>Your rights</h3>
            <p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at The Relay Building 1st Floor, 114 Whitechapel High Street, London E1 7PT, or e-mailed here admin@airstudio.co.uk .</p>
